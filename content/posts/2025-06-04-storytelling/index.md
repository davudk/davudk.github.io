When you hear "storytelling" you might be tempted to imagine a grown-up reading to a child. We often see it as a pastime to entertain and teach children. At its heart, storytelling isn't actually about making stuff up —though fiction is certainly a part of it. It’s a huge part of everyday life and a really important people skill that helps you build strong relationships with others.

Storytelling is about the clever way we share our ideas. Whether we say them out loud or write them, our words are how we get our thoughts out. The main goal is for another person to not only hear or read our words but to truly understand what we mean.

In that regard, one might view words as the serialization of thoughts.

And this is where good storytellers shine. They know how to pick the right words, the right tone, and the right way to put things together for the person they're talking to. They make sure the other person understands the same original idea with as little effort as possible.

You might therefore think storytelling is systematic and procedural; that it's just about being factual. While facts and observations are indeed part of a good story, great communication—real storytelling—means talking in a way that makes people want to listen and helps build trust. It's not about dropping tons of facts and citations to change minds, but rather about achieving that impact with the fewest, most meaningful words.

This isn't about tricking people or being fake. It’s actually the opposite. Real storytelling, in this sense, is about being honest and connecting with others genuinely so everyone understands each other better. It’s about personalizing your words to resonate with your audience.

It's a skill worth getting better at, not just for entertainment, but for every conversation, every interaction, and every relationship we have.

Storytelling is definitely an art.
